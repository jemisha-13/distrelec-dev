<h4>Misc:</h4>
- Remove all Message Entries for all content catalogs in the hMC (Internationalization --> Message Entries)
  (use /environment/release-notes/samples-scripts/impexScripts/removeAllMessageResourceTableEntries.impex for large amount on items)
- DISTRELEC-7337: Please check that the new jvm parameter has been correctly configured in the system.
	Please run the following command after the platworm starts up on every single hybris application node:
	ps -aux | grep PrintCompilation
	The result of the command should be a java (tomcat) process. If no java process appear it means that the java parameter has been not correctly copied in the ant task.
	Additionally, if everything works fine in the hybris application logs many strange lines should appear. These lines are the JIT cache log. This is correct.


<h4>Synchronization:</h4>
