;CMSParagraphComponent_CH-AGB;"<p>Distrelec,  Branch of Distrelec Group AG<br /> (May, 2014)<br /> Your  purchase contract is concluded with the company Distrelec, Distrelec Schweiz AG</br />c/o Lenz & Staehelin Aktiengesellschaft<br />Brandschenkestrasse 24, CH-8001 Zürich<br /> Email: <a href=""mailto:info@distrelec.com"">info@distrelec.com</a><br /> Telephone: +31 (0) 30 265 01 00<br /> Fax: +31 (0) 30 262 20 24<br /> Company  number: 007080074<br /> Commercial Register number: NL30048971<br /> VAT ID number: NL0070.80.074.B.01</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h2>1. Scope</h2> <h3>1.1</h3> <p>All  claims arising from and in connection with a contract concluded between the  customer and Distrelec for the catalogue and online trade are always subject to  these General Terms and Conditions, in their valid version at the time of  concluding the contract.</p> <h3>1.2</h3> <p>In the  case of conflicting provisions the order of precedence shall be:<br /> 1. Special terms of business for the  individual services;<br /> 2. These General Terms and Conditions;<br /> 3. Provisions of the law.</p> <h2>2. Participants</h2> <p>Distrelec  concludes contracts with customers who<br /> a) have reached the age of 18 and have the capacity to act, and with<br /> b) legal persons who are domiciled in Switzerland or in a member state of the  European Union (hereinafter referred to as &quot;Customers&quot;). Should an  offer for an unaccepted customer be mistakenly taken on by Distrelec, then  Distrelec is entitled to declare its withdrawal from the contract with the  customer within an appropriate period.</p> <h2>3. Object of the contract</h2> <p>Distrelec  shall deliver the goods ordered by the customer, or provide the services,  within the framework of the acceptance of the offer. If a  withdrawal/cancellation takes place, Distrelec is obliged to immediately credit  to the customer's account any installments  and/or advance payments that may have been paid or, if requested, to repay them  by means of a bank transfer.</p> <h2>4. Conclusion of contract</h2> <h3>4.1</h3> <p>The  contract is concluded after Distrelec accepts the customer's order.<br /> Acceptance by Distrelec takes place when the customer receives the goods after  they have been sent by Distrelec, or when the service to the customer is  performed by Distrelec. If the customer places an order via the Internet,  Distrelec shall promptly confirm the receipt of the order by electronic means.  But the confirmation of the order does not yet constitute an acceptance of the  contract.</p> <h3>4.2</h3> <p>The  language of the contract is preferable Dutch or  English.</p> <h2>5. Unavailability of ordered goods or service</h2> <p>Should  Distrelec find after the order has been received that the ordered item or  service is no longer available from Distrelec, any payments that have already  been made shall be immediately reimbursed. Distrelec may choose to send, offer  or provide to the customer an item or service of the same quality and price. In  such a case, the customer is not obliged to accept. Distrelec shall bear the  cost if such an item is returned by post.</p> <h2>6. Delivery/shipping costs</h2> <h3>6.1</h3> <p>Unless  the contractual parties have made other arrangements regarding the delivery  time, Distrelec shall deliver the goods by transferring physical possession of  the goods or control over the goods to you as customer, promptly, and not later  than 30 (thirty) days after conclusion of the contract.</p> <h3>6.2</h3> <p>If  Distrelec fails to comply with its obligation to deliver the goods at the time  arranged with you as the customer, or within the set period stated in clause 1,  then as the customer you shall then ask Distrelec to make the delivery within  an extended deadline appropriate to the circumstances. If Distrelec does not  deliver the goods within this extended deadline, then as the customer you are  entitled to withdraw from the contract.</p> <h3>6.3</h3> <p>If the  customer orders a shipment using the 24-hour service, and the goods do not  arrive even within a reasonable grace period that may be appropriate in certain  cases, the customer is entitled to withdraw from the contract and return the  goods to Distrelec. Claims for damages are excluded in such cases, unless Distrelec  had acted intentionally or in gross negligence.</p> <h3>6.4</h3> <p>Distrelec shall take care to ensure a quick delivery, subject to its receiving  the goods from its supplier. If part of the order cannot be delivered  immediately, the remaining items shall be delivered later without recalculating  the flat rate for shipping.</p> <h3>6.5</h3> <p>The  shipping and handling costs are based on the value of the order and as well on  the selected logistics service. <br /> Postage is including packaging.</p> <h3>6.6</h3> <p>Some  products, which are imported from the USA by Distrelec and/or are manufactured  in the USA, are subject to the export control regulations of the USA and other  countries, in particular Germany. It is the customer's responsibility to ensure  that the export control regulations are complied with, and he undertakes to  obtain all the required export licences and other necessary documents, at his  own expense, before the products and/or technical information that he is to  receive from Distrelec are exported.<br /> The  customer also undertakes to neither directly nor indirectly sell, export,  re-export, supply or otherwise pass on any products or technical information  that are subject to export control regulations, to persons, companies  (enterprises) or countries where this infringes against the US American or  other, in particular German, export control laws, directives, restrictions and  provisions. The customer undertakes to inform all the recipients of these  products or technical information about the need to comply with these laws and  directives.<br /> If an  authority refuses to grant an export permit, this does not entitle the customer  to withdraw from the contract or to claims for damages. Distrelec is not  obliged to issue to the customer a supplier's declaration or a long-term  supplier's declaration, or to obtain such from its own suppliers.</p> <h2>7. Price, payment terms</h2> <h3>7.1</h3> <p>The  prices in the private customer catalogues are final prices including the VAT  amount valid on the catalogue&rsquo;s issue date. Should the statutory VAT be  increased after the catalogue is issued, Distrelec is obliged to apply the  higher VAT rate in the invoice. Generally, prices in the business catalogues  are net prices.</p> <h3>7.2</h3> <p>On the  invoice, the cost of additional services is listed next to the net price:  packing, shipping, 24-hour service, etc., as well as the VAT at the rate valid  on the invoice date (for private customers).</p> <h3>7.3</h3> <p>For  orders placed via Distrelec website pages, instead of the catalogue prices, the  prices shown below the button [button ordering procedure] when executing the  order apply.</p> <h3>7.4</h3> <p>Distrelec reserves the right to exclude certain modes of payment in individual  cases in order to protect against credit risk, and to carry out the requested  deliveries only on payment in advance.</p> <h3>7.5</h3> <p>The standard payment term is 15 days net from date of invoice unless otherwise  agreed. If payments are overdue outstanding invoices will be, regardless of any  additional collection costs, charged with the statutory rate.</p> <h2>8. Retention of title</h2> <p>Distrelec  retains ownership of all goods that it delivers to a customer until the final  payment for the supplied goods has been made in full. Insofar as Distrelec  replaces an item within the framework of the warranty, it is already now agreed  that the ownership of the item to be replaced passes by way of reciprocal  exchange from the customer to Distrelec or vice versa at the moment when  Distrelec receives the item sent back from the customer, or when the customer  receives the replacement item from Distrelec.</p> <h2>9. Warranty</h2> <h3>9.1</h3> <p>Distrelec warrants that the product is free from material defects and defects  of title at the time of the passing of risk.</p> <h3>9.2</h3> <p>Should  the delivered goods have obvious visible defects in materials or manufacturing,  which also includes damage during shipping, you must report such defects to  Distrelec within 10 (ten) days. Concealed defects are to be reported within the  same period measured from when they are discovered. Otherwise the warranty  obligation of Distrelec does not apply.</p> <h3>9.3</h3> <p>The  term of warranty for new items is 12 months. This period may be extended if the manufacturer uses an  extended term of warranty. For items that are designated in their  respective product offers as fully refurbished and/or as ex-display items, the  warranty is 12 months. The warranty period starts from the time the particular  item is received by the customer.</p> <h3>9.4</h3> <p>If the item is found to be defective, the customer may  request that the defect be remedied. If in the course of the repairs the defect  could not be remedied, even at the second attempt, the customer is entitled to  request delivery of an item that is free of defects, or a reduction in the  purchase price, or to withdraw from the contract.</p> <h3>9.5</h3> <p>Regarding any claims for damages due to defects in the items, the provisions of  the law apply.</p> <h3>9.6</h3> <p>The  precondition for any claims under warranty is that the defect is not caused by  improper use or excessive stress. If a defect is discovered over 6 months after  the handover, the customer must provide evidence that the item was defective at  the time of the passing of risk.</p> <h2>10. Liability</h2> <h3>10.1</h3> <p>Distrelec  accepts full liability where the cause of the loss or damage is due to an  intentional or grossly negligent breach of duty by Distrelec or by one of its  legal representatives or by an ancillary of Distrelec. Otherwise liability is  excluded, within the bounds of the law.</p> <h3>10.2</h3> <p>The  above restrictions of liability do not apply to injuries to life, body and  health, to a defect after assuming a warranty for the properties of a product,  and to fraudulently concealed defects.</p> <h3>10.3</h3> <p>In the  event of loss of data, Distrelec only accepts liability in the case of  intentional or grossly negligent breach of duty, and then only if there is  evidence that you as customer have regularly backed up the data at least once a  day.&nbsp; The liability for loss of data is  limited to the cost of restoring it when a back-up copy is available.</p> <h2>11. Returns</h2> <h3>11.1</h3> <p>Purchased products may be returned or exchanged, after approval of Distrelec,  within 30 days of receiving date. The product has to be undamaged and packed in  the original undamaged packaging.</p> <h3>11.2</h3> <p>Exception of the right to return are unsealed audio or video recordings or  software, all products specially ordered which are not part of our normal  product assortment as well as semiconductors, maintenance products such as  aerosols and adhesives, batteries, cable (unless there is an unopened roll),  special offers, promotional products and selling-off products. This list is not  limited to the given products and product categories, but can be extended with  other products and product categories which are perishable or have an  inextricably related expiry date.</p> <h3>11.3</h3> <p>The return after 30 days of receiving date of no longer needed or wrongly  purchased products, is only possible after approval of Distrelec. If the return  is accepted by Distrelec, a rate of 20% of the invoice value of the goods or  EUR 10, - depending on what the highest amount is, will be charged.</p> <h2>12. Service and repair</h2> <h3>12.1</h3> <p>The return of a from Distrelec purchased product for service and/or repair is  only possible after approval of Distrelec. In case of a warranty&nbsp; repair, the return includes a copy of the  Distrelec invoice as well.</p> <h2>13. Applicable law</h2> <h3>13.1</h3> <p>The legal relations  between Distrelec and the customers, and the respective terms of business, are  subject to Dutch law. The application of the UN  Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods of 11.04.1988 is  excluded.</p> <h2>14. Miscellaneous</h2> <h3>14.1</h3> <p>The customer does not  have any right to a set-off or retention, unless the claim is undisputed or  established with legal effect by a court.</p> <h3>14.2</h3> <p>Should individual  provisions of this contract be partly or wholly invalid or subsequently lose  their legal validity, then this shall not affect the validity of the remaining  part of the contract.</p> <h3>14.3</h3> <p>The catalogue / website  published by us and its entire content, in particular the texts, photos, or  other graphics or illustrations and any software, as well as all trade-marks,  patents, and utility models, are all protected against unauthorized  use by industrial property rights, in particular copyrights, name and image  rights, trade-marks, patents or utility models that have come into effect. Use  beyond searching for and purchasing of an item requires our prior written  consent or, if the respective rights are not owned by us, the prior written  consent of the legal owner.</p> <h3>14.4</h3> <p>We reserve the right to  make changes at any time to our website, regulations, terms, including these  terms of sale. Your order is subject to the General Terms and Conditions in  effect when you place your order, except where an amendment to these terms is  required by law or by government decree (in such case the amendment also  applies to orders that you have made previously).</p> <h3>14.5</h3> <p>For disputes arising  from the contracts between the customer and Distrelec and concerning the  formation of the contracts, the regular court at the location of the registered  office of Distrelec shall  have sole jurisdiction. <br /> <br /> Status as  at: 15.05.2014</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>

</style></p><p><strong>1. Right of revocation <br /> </strong><br /> Because of the customer's legal right of revocation, the order and its acceptance by Distrelec BV   initially result in a provisional contractual relationship that is still pending. You as customer may revoke your contractual declaration within 7 (seven) days &ndash; by using the revocation form, or by making a corresponding declaration in any other form that makes clear your decision to revoke the contract. The deadline period starts from the time of receiving these instructions in text form, but not before the goods are delivered to the customer or to a third party designated by the customer. For the revocation period to be granted, the goods are to be promptly sent back to&nbsp;Distrelec BV &nbsp;or to a person that it has authorised to receive the goods, and in any case within the set term of 7 (seven) days. Where the delivery of the item takes place in more than one partial shipment or parts, the deadline period starts from the time the last partial shipment or the last part is received.<br /> <br /> The revocation should be addressed to:</p> <p><strong>Distrelec BV<br /> Fax: +32 02 511 28 77<br />Email: </strong><a class=""mailto"" href=""mailto:sales.be@distrelec.com"" style=""font-size: 16px; font-weight: 300;""><strong>sales.be@distrelec.com</strong></a><strong><br /> <br type=""_moz"" /> </strong></p> <p><strong>2. Consequences of revocation</strong></p> <p>In the case of a valid revocation, the services (goods/payments) received by either party are to be returned within 7 (seven) days from the time the valid revocation decision is announced (see 5.1), and any benefits that have been drawn (e.g. interest) shall be handed over.&nbsp;Distrelec BV &nbsp;is only obliged to refund the standard delivery charges to the customer.</p> <p>If the customer is unable or only partly able to return or hand over the services received and the benefits (e.g. advantages of use), or only in an impaired condition, the customer is obliged to pay compensation for the respective lost value. The customer is only obliged to pay compensation for the lost value due to the impairment of the item and for benefits drawn, where the benefits or the impairments are caused by using the item beyond the mere testing of properties and functioning. By &quot;testing the properties and functioning&quot; is meant the testing and trying out of the respective item in the manner that is possible and commonly occurs, for example, in a retail store.</p> <p>Items that can be returned in the packaging are to be sent back at our risk. If a return of the goods is not possible on account of the weight or bulkiness of the package, it suffices if the customer sends a written request to arrange a return to&nbsp;Distrelec BV &nbsp;within the 7-day period starting from the time the goods are received. The customer shall bear the standard costs of the return shipment if the goods can be sent back by post.</p> <p>After the customer has declared a revocation in accordance with the deadline and formal requirements, and the item has been received by&nbsp;Distrelec BV, then&nbsp;Distrelec BV&nbsp;shall refund the payment within 7 (seven) days.<br /> &nbsp;</p> <p><strong>3. Exceptions to the right of revocation</strong></p> <p>There is no right of revocation in the case of:</p> <ul>     <li>deliveries of goods that were tailor-made to customer's specifications or were evidently modified to match the customer's personal requirements, or that are not suitable for returning because of their properties, or that might quickly spoil, or whose sell-by date has expired.</li>     <li>the delivery of audio or video recordings or of software if the data carriers have been unsealed by the customer.</li>     <li>the delivery of newspapers, journals and magazines, unless the customer concluded the contract over the telephone.</li>     <li>deliveries of digital content that are not supplied on a physical data carrier, if the execution has already started with the prior consent of the customer and he has acknowledged that this means that he loses his right of revocation.</li> </ul> <p>Before returning devices with storage media (e.g. hard disks, USB drives, mobile phones etc.), please note the following instructions:</p> <p>You are basically responsible for safeguarding the data. Please make appropriate back-up copies or delete any personal data contained in them. This is especially important when the personal data of third parties is stored.</p> <p>If it is not possible to delete this because of some defect, then we ask that you expressly inform us that personal data is present. Please note this in a clearly visible way on the return slip.</p> <p>End of the instructions about the right of revocation.</p>"

This shows you that the product has been successfully added to the list of favourites.</li>     <li>On the details-view page for that particular product, the heart button is shown at the right side below the availability indicator.</li>     <li>To view the current contents of your favourites list, move the cursor onto the &quot;Lists&quot; button ( the second button to the right of the search box), and click on &quot;My favourite products&quot; in the menu that opens.</li>     <li>On the page that opens, you will see all the products listed that you have added to your favourites. To remove a product from the list, move your cursor onto the product and click on the x-symbol that appears at the right border.</li> </ul> <p><b>Lists of products or shopping lists</b></p> <ul>     <li>To add a product from a product list or from an offer teaser to a shopping list, move your cursor onto the particular product and click on the lists icon that appears.</li>     <li>A window then opens where you can specify which shopping list you want to save this product to. Choose one or more of the existing lists, or enter the name for a new list, where the product is to be saved.</li>     <li>On the details-view page for the particular product, the appropriate list button is shown at the right side below the availability indicator.</li>     <li>To view the contents of a shopping list, move the cursor onto the &quot;Lists&quot; button ( the second button to the right of the search box), and click on the name of the desired list in the menu that opens. (If the name of the list is not shown, click on the link &quot;Show all lists&quot; at the end of the menu.)</li>     <li>On the right side of the window, you will now see all products in your shopping list, with the corresponding quantities. To remove a product from the shopping list, move your cursor onto the product and click on the x-symbol that appears next to the quantity.</li>     <li>You now have the option of adding the contents of your shopping list to the current contents of your shopping basket, using the button &quot;Add list to cart&quot;.</li>     <li>Alternatively, you can download the list as a file via the button with the downward-pointing arrow. As soon as you click on this symbol you can choose between downloading as an XLS or a CSV file.     <ul>         <li>XLS: Microsoft Excel file: You can open and edit this file directly in Excel.</li>         <li>CSV: A plain text file that contains the contents of your shopping basked in the form of Comma-Separated Values. Such CSV files can be interpreted and processed by many different programs.</li>     </ul></li> </ul> <p>(Files downloaded in the XLS and the CSV format are both compatible with the parts-lists import tool.)</p> <p><a name=""FAQ12""><br /> </a></p> <h3>12.

You can sort this list according to various criteria.</li>     <li>To limit the number of products, the filter bar at the left offers the following methods:</li> </ol> <p><b>Filtering by another subcategory:</b><br /> At the top of the bar, sub-categories within the current category are shown (if available). Choose a sub-category to further limit the selection of products.</p> <ul>     <li>Filtering by manufacturer or product feature: below the categories, you will find the sections for manufacturer or product features. Choose the properties you want here, by clicking on the box next to the manufacturer or the product feature. You can select more than one attribute per section, for example both &quot;Manufacturer A&quot; and &quot;Manufacturer B&quot;.</li>     <li>Filtering by availability: in the availability section, you can set as a filter criterion the immediate availability of the item.</li>     <li>Filtering by price: drag the slider to the left or right until the suitable price range is shown below the scale.</li>     <li>For each of the constraints or filtering criteria described above, a label is shown in the &quot;Filter&quot; section which indicates an active filter criterion. Click on the &quot;x&quot; inside the label to remove this filter criterion again.</li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

;ordering_headline;"<h3>Postage costs and shipping charges</h3>"
;payment_security;"<h3>Payment and payment methods</h3>
<p><strong>Payment by invoice:</strong></p>
<p>Terms of payment: 30 days</p>
<p><strong>iDEAL:</strong></p>
<p>IDEAL allows you trusted, secure and easy online paying. You pay in the familiar online banking environment of your own bank.</p>
<p><strong>Paypal:</strong></p>
<p>PayPal is an officially recognized, secure web-based payment system. To pay this way, log onto PayPal using your registration details and confirm the payment to Distrelec BV. Your bank details or credit card number are stored in your PayPal account. This means that the information is not sent anywhere else while making your payment.</p>
<p><strong>Credit card:</strong></p>
<p>No extra fee is charged for credit card payment.</p>
<h3>3-D Secure Authentication process</h3>
<p><strong>What is 3D Secure?</strong><br />
We use the 3D Secure authentication process to ensure that your credit card transactions are as secure as possible. The &quot;3D&quot; symbolises the three parties involved in this process: the cardholder, the card-issuing bank and the retailer. Visa calls this process&nbsp;<a href=""/cms/certificates"">&quot;Verified by Visa&quot;</a>, while MasterCard uses the name&nbsp;<a href=""/cms/certificates"">&quot;MasterCard SecureCode&ldquo;</a>. 3D Secure ensures that the lawful card holder and the lawful online retailer can conduct a transaction. Using this process means that risk of fraud is effectively reduced in the e-commerce sector.</p>
<p><strong>How does 3D Secure work?</strong><br />
When paying for a purchase by credit card, a window for your bank is opened in which you must enter your personal security code. This code will have been sent to you by your bank and is therefore known only to you and your credit card company. The code must not be recorded or appear on the card itself and must not be confused with the three or four-digit CVC code on the back of the credit card (this code is also often requested). Once you have been successfully identified, the payment is carried out.</p>
<p><strong>I have not activated my personal security code.</strong><br />
If your bank supports 3D Secure but you have yet to activate a personal password, it is possible to create this password during the check-out process yourself.</p>"

  </div>

  </div>
  <div class=""row"">
  <div class=""col-sm-12"">
  <p>Many of us probably know about robots from movies or the television. In science fiction, they range from the Terminator-style, virtually indistinguishable from human killing machines, to the rather cute R2-D2 from the Star Wars franchise. But the reality of robots always seems a little less exciting. The evening news often shows robots working in automotive factories, large lumbering arms with sparks flying everywhere as they weld together parts.</p>
  <p>The reality is that there are wide range of robots already in use across many industries, helping us on a daily basis. Manufacturing is one area where automation plays a significant role. Machines don’t need to take breaks, they can accurately perform repetitive tasks that humans find dull, and are unlikely to introduce contaminants into the materials they are processing. This is especially important in the food processing and pharmaceutical industries.</p>
  <p>Such industrial robots take many forms. Robot arms, known as articulated robots, can have as many as 10 rotary joints, allowing them to perform complex movements to access around, and inside, the objects on which they are working. The arms themselves are normally universal, with the ability to attach a range of different tools to their wrist. Tools include welders, grippers to pick up and move objects, and even spray heads to paint and coat surfaces.</p>
  <p>In the field of medicine, robots are being trialled to complement and even, for some types of surgery, replace the surgeon altogether. The CyberKnife is a robotic radiosurgery system that is used in the treatment of benign and malignant tumours. It features a small linear particle accelerator affixed to an articulated arm. An X-ray camera helps with positioning. The goal is to provide precise amounts of radiotherapy at the locations required, with the robot arm making it possible to apply the dose from any location around the body.</p>
  <p>Hospitals are also starting to trial robots that handle the dispensing of medicines to patients. This leads to fewer mistakes, a faster dispensary and fewer cases of cross-contamination. Trials are also ongoing with cleaning robots to disinfect hospital wards and patient’s rooms. This is of special interest for areas handling infectious diseases and contagions. Rather than using chemicals, the cleaning robots use ultraviolet light, allowing an entire room to be cleaned in just a few minutes.</p>
  <p>In the UK town of Milton Keynes, delivery robots are being trialled for the delivery of food and parcels. The six-wheeled autonomously guided vehicles (AGV) can transport up to 10kg and feature a range of sensors, radar and GPS to help them safely reach their destination. Developed by Starship Robots, the vehicles managed to overcome the UK’s snowy weather to successfully complete takeaway deliveries while other business’ delivery drivers were stuck in traffic. Upon arrival, the customer receives a pin-code by SMS, allowing them to retrieve their purchase from inside the vehicle.</p>
  <p>Our emergency services and military are also supported by robots in extreme situations. Devices such as the Dragon Runner, a twin-tracked and highly manoeuvrable robot, can be used to investigate bombs and other suspicious items. Fitted with a camera and tools, it can provide insights into such dangers, cut wires and even plant small charges to disrupt devices. Forth Engineering recently demonstrated a hydraulic, spider-like robot, designed for use in nuclear plants such as the Sellafield facility. Such robots can enter environments unsuitable for humans, undertaking complex clear-up operations and decommissioning tasks.</p>
  <p>For those wanting to get a feel for what is possible there are plenty of robotics kits available. Based around the popular Arduino development environment and tools, the Braccio Robot Arm from Tinkerkit is an articulated arm with gripper. Its six servo motors connect to an Arduino compatible shield for easy development.</p>

Back during the time of ancient Greece, the &lsquo;metal man&rsquo; Talos was gifted by Zeus to Europa. Talos was a giant automaton made of bronze, built to protect Europa at her home on the island of Crete. Circling the island&rsquo;s shores three times a day, he was to provide protection from pirates and invaders.</p> <p>Although Talos only existed in a story of Greek mythology, the discovery of the Antikythera mechanism in 1902 shows that the Greeks had developed complex mechanical technology as far back as 87 to 205 BC. This device, composed of at least 30 meshing bronze gears, was an analogue computer designed to function as an orrery, a machine to predict astronomical positions for astrological purposes.</p> <p>Hero of Alexandria, a Greek who lived from around 10 until 70 AD, was a mathematician and engineer. Although the field of cybernetics was not formalised until the twentieth century, his work on automated devices is considered to represent the first formal research into this area.</p> <p>is work &lsquo;Automata&rsquo; describes machines that enable wonders in temples, such as automatic doors and statues that pour wine. Such functions were made possible as a result of his studies into the harnessing of steam pressure, wind and water.</p> <p>A further source of historical mechanical innovation come from the works of Da Vinci. Many have attempted to recreate his machines from his drawings. Some items are complete solutions, such as a flying machine or machines of war. Others are simply mechanisms for pulleys, or systems that create oscillating motion.</p> <p>He also designed and possibly built a mechanical knight, an automaton that was clad in medieval armour. The design notes, rediscovered in the 1950s, indicate that it was operated by a series of pulleys and cables, and was capable of standing up, sitting down and moving its arms.</p> <p>Perhaps one of the most impactful implementations of automation was during the twentieth century at the Ford Motor Company. Impressed by the use of conveyor belts common in many grain warehouses in the Midwest, Henry Ford worked with Frederick Taylor to implement the same concepts at the factory manufacturing the Ford Model T. His goal was to introduce efficiencies to the manufacturing process that would help to bring the price down, making the motor vehicle more accessible to the public.</p> <p>Using a chain conveyor, the vehicle chassis was pulled along the 150-foot long line while 140 workers applied their assigned parts to the vehicle. With further workers employed to ensure that everyone had a stock of parts to hand, the assembly time per vehicle was significantly decreased. Overall, the assembly line technique, and automation technology employed, reduced the production time for a single vehicle from more than 12 hours to just over 90 minutes.</p> <p>In 1914, Ford produced more motor vehicles than all the other automobile manufacturers combined.</p> <p>As more and more machines came into use, the reality of robots working with and assisting humans became more tangible. Science fiction, fired up by continued advances in technology, liked to consider how this human-machine partnership may play out.</p> <p>Isaac Asimov, an American writer and professor of biochemistry, noted that one of the stock plots of science fiction was that robots were created and subsequently destroyed by their creator. This led to his creation of The Three Laws, a set of rules devised to ensure that robots do not injure human beings, obey orders and protect their own existence.</p> <p>To date, it is up to the programmers of robots to ensure such rules are followed. However, with autonomous, artificial intelligence driven robots and vehicles now within grasp, groups now exist that seriously examine the ethical, legal and socio-economic issues surrounding such machines.</p> <p>If you&rsquo;d like to learn more about the history of robotics, download Distrelec&rsquo;s &ldquo;A Guide to Robotics and Automation&rdquo; which also includes a 10% discount code for your next order.</p></div></div></div></div>"
