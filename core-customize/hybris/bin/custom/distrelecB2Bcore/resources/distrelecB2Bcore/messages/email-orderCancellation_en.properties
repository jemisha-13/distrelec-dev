line1=unfortunately we have had to cancel your recent order with us. This is because an item in your order went out of stock while you were checking out.
line2=We regret to inform you that due to the way our processing and shipping works, your whole order has been cancelled, even if it contained other unaffected products. We are not able to allow back-orders at this time, but you can return to the product page and register your interest in the product that has gone out of stock by leaving your email. You will then be notified when the product is back in stock.
line3=We won't charge you for your order, but your bank may have placed a temporary hold on the funds in your account. If this has happened, funds will normally be returned within a few days. You can also call your bank and ask them to speed this up, which some banks can accommodate. Unfortunately this is outside of Distrelec's control.
