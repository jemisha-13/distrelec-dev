title = Conflict Minerals Statement

paragraph1 = Conflict minerals include <strong>tantalum, tin, tungsten and gold</strong>, which are used in many electronic components and computer products. In 2010, the United States passed the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act - the Dodd Frank Act. Section 1502 thereof introduces supply chain transparency by requiring companies listed on US stock exchange using ' conflict minerals' in their production processes to declare the origin of such minerals and perform appropriate supply chain due diligence. 

paragraph2 = Although the scope of the legislation is formally restricted to US-listed companies, it is having considerable effects abroad, including the EU, mainly through global supply chains because suppliers to US-listed companies are being asked to contribute due diligence information. 

paragraph3 = As a leading distributor for electronics, automation, and measurement technology as well as for IT and accessories, Distrelec promotes the traceability of these minerals and the transparency of the supply chain. 

paragraph4 = Distrelec firmly believes that its customers should be fully informed about the products they purchase and is committed to working with its suppliers to provide products that meet customersâ€™ specifications. 

paragraph5 = Important information on the use of conflict minerals is provided to all suppliers via the section "compliance with laws and regulations" in the Distrelec supplier code of conduct.

paragraph6 = To this end Distrelec expects its suppliers to only source minerals from responsible sources. 

paragraph7 = We do not have direct access to information regarding where our suppliers procure their raw materials. Nevertheless, we are working with our suppliers to obtain and provide you with that information. 

paragraph8 = Distrelec does not directly purchase any conflict minerals from any source and strives not to purchase products that contain conflict minerals that directly or indirectly finance or benefit armed groups in the Democratic Republic of Congo or adjoining countries. 

paragraph9 = Distrelec fully understands the importance of this issue to its customers and is committed to supply chain initiatives together with overall corporate social responsibility and sustainability efforts that work towards a conflict free supply chain. We encourage all of our suppliers to sign our code of conduct, including a confirmation only to deliver us conflict free products.
