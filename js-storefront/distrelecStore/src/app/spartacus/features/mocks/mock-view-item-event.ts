The embedded circuitry makes this possible <br/>• Power relays: A power relay uses an electromagnetic coil to open or close a circuit <br/>• Reed relays: Reed relays use a magnetic field near to the reed relay contacts. This then causes the contacts to close together with their magnetic orientation <br/>• Safety relays: Safety relays are designed to stop switching on when faults have been detected <br/>• Solid state relays: Solid state relays function the same as most relays, however, as a solid state component they do not contain any moving parts, making them more reliable in the long term as physical damage is a low risk',

Rhe switch needs to be held in position 2 (On) to operate. This ensures that a device does not operate when the switch is not active <br/>• Joystick switches: Ideal in construction, these switches are used for operating machinery or systems by hand, allowing the user to move right, left, up and down. <br/>• Key operated switches: When access to a switch is restricted, a key switch is needed, ensuring an operation is secured to only allow certain people access to the operation <br/>• Rocker switches: The most common type of switch, the rocker switch is used for on/off processes such as light switches and power switches for appliances <br/>• Rotary switches: Another common on/off switch, the rotary switch uses a turning motion to navigate between on and off and sometimes more options when a user is prompted to select a certain level of power',
