The armature rotates or lifts as soon as the electric current in the coil is switched on and the magnetic field is built up. The higher the current, the stronger the magnetic field and the greater the lifting force or torque. <br/>With a holding solenoid, on the other hand, nothing moves. When active, it can hold ferromagnetic objects. Holding magnets are often used to operate mechanical levers or safety elements.',
