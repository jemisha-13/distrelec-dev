These visual or sound alarms are used within machines and operating systems to help prevent incidents and periods of non-productivity. Our range includes signal and stacking beacons in a large array of colours, sizes and module types, alongside bells, signals and horns.<br/><br/>We also stock a broad range of control components, including counters, timers, temperature controllers and process instruments. Operating panels, known collectively as Human Machine Interfaces, are used to input information, which is translated into signals for machines, while process control equipment is essential for managing and monitoring automation equipment. Browse our vast range to find specialised HMIs and control components suitable for your operations. Industrial robots and robotics gripper kits are also available. <br/><br/>Commanding switches, lights, buttons and emergency stop switches, all of which give instructions and signals to automation applications, are included in our range, along with solenoids and actuators.

This ensures that a device does not operate when the switch is not active <br/>• Joystick switches: Ideal in construction, these switches are used for operating machinery or systems by hand, allowing the user to move right, left, up and down. <br/>• Key operated switches: When access to a switch is restricted, a key switch is needed, ensuring an operation is secured to only allow certain people access to the operation <br/>• Rocker switches: The most common type of switch, the rocker switch is used for on/off processes such as light switches and power switches for appliances <br/>• Rotary switches: Another common on/off switch, the rotary switch uses a turning motion to navigate between on and off and sometimes more options when a user is prompted to select a certain level of power',
